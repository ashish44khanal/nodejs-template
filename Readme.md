## Building the project
```

### Running the build
All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts].

| Npm Script | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`                   | Runs full build and runs node on dist/index.js. Can be invoked with `npm start`                  |
| `build`                   | Full build. Runs ALL build tasks       |       
| `dev`                   | Runs application in development mode with nodemon watching the tasks. Can be invoked with `npm dev`                                         |

## npm install fails
The current solution has an example for using a private npm repository. if you want to use the public npm repository, remove the .npmrc file.
